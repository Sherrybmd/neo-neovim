### backup based on ThePrimeagen's init.lua (nvim)
Crerequisite: install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
need this for <leader>ps (grep search) to work

based on ThePrimeagen/init.lua but functional on remote systems, because i just changed the local machine refrences to his github instead.

manually install lua-rock or something to version 5.1 and above.

gopls still has issues, couldn't fix lsp for that one yet.

everything else works, minus streamer and local address plugins, which didnt do anything.
